# fame
> App framework based on Famo.us.

## Preface

Famo.us is a supreme javascript library for building great apps, including mobile web apps(mostly, SPAs). 
However, before focusing on business logics, there are several works we MUST deal with, like:
  * handling datas: Ajax, GET, POST, callbacks...
  * basic mobile-layout 
  * page switching/toggling
  * mobile widgets: navbar, sidebar, datepicker, ...

Hopefully `Fame` could do these necessary works for you.

## Principle

The ultimate target of `Fame` is to provide a set of re-usable and configurable components(e.g: buttons, sidebars) as well as a basic workflow of developing HTML5 mobile apps based on [Famo.us](http://famo.us), and our team believes [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) would be the future of mobile app designing. So here's the principles:

* Mobile-oriented
* Material Design
* Reusable and configurable.
* Well modulized (thus any components could be used seperately).

## Usage 

TODO(since it's under active development, LOL)
