> App framework based on Famo.us.

## Preface

Famo.us is a supreme javascript library for building great apps, including mobile web apps(mostly, SPAs). 
However, before focusing on business logics, there are several works we MUST deal with, like:
  * handling datas: Ajax, GET, POST, callbacks...
  * basic mobile-layout 
  * page switching/toggling
  * mobile widgets: navbar, sidebar, datepicker, ...

Hopefully `Fame` could do these necessary works for you.
